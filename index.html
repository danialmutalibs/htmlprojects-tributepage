    Here is the timeline of al-Khwarizimi's life:
    <ul>
        <li><b>c. 780 -</b> Born Khwarezm (modern Uzbekistan)</li>
        <li><b>c. 850 -</b> Died Baghdad, Iraq</li>
        <li><b>c. 813–833 - </b> Presented the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Regarding al-Khwārizmī's religion, Toomer writes:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi#cite_note-toomer2-28">
    Another epithet given to him by al-Ṭabarī, "al-Majūsī," would seem to indicate that he was an adherent of the old
    Zoroastrian religion. This would still have been possible at that time for a man of Iranian origin, but the pious
    preface to al-Khwārizmī's Algebra shows that he was an orthodox Muslim, so al-Ṭabarī's epithet could mean no more than
    that his forebears, and perhaps he in his youth, had been Zoroastrians.
